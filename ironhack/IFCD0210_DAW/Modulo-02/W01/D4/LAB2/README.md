Segundo proyecto de la semana 1 en el curso de ironhack

## Tareas

- Create an Employee class to represent an employee of a company. The class should have name, email, age, salary properties and appropriate getters and setters.
- Create an Intern class that extends from Employee. The Intern class should have a salary limit of 20000 (constant).
- Implement validation in the Intern class to ensure that an intern is not created (or salary updated) with a salary that exceeds the maximum allowed value.
- Write a program that creates 10 Employee objects and prints all of their properties (name, email, age, salary) to a file named employees.txt
